Use this page to draw a map or directed graph of current and potential
actors in your ecosystem. List service providers and group them by the
type of service they offer. Identify potential collaborators, and mark
the ones with competitive service offerings. Identify competing open
source and proprietary substitutes for your open source project.

Place actors with large, current impact closer to the center of the map
and future recruits further away. The open source project belongs at the
center; your company might be close in or further out, depending on its
current effective scale of investment.

Don't aim for a perfect representation of the project's ecosystem at
first. Just get lots of things down on paper --- then you can rearrange,
regroup, recategorize, and edit them as needed. When done, note
interesting relationships between various nodes on the map. Add
customers in another color. This map is a picture of your world as it
currently exists and how it might change in the near-term future. Be
sure to save a snapshot of this map and see how it shifts over time.
