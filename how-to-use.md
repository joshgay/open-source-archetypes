\unnumberedsection{How to Use This Document}
The archetypes presented here (categorized in section ) are not business
strategies in themselves; rather, they are consequences of business
strategy decisions.

For any project that Mozilla starts, acquires, or revives, the question
of how to run it must start with the question of what Mozilla is trying
to accomplish with it in the first place. Once there is a clear
understanding of the project's goals, it becomes possible to discuss
what kind of an open source project it should be.

We therefore suggest that this report be used as follows:

1.  First articulate to all stakeholders the goals of the project: what
    aspects of Mozilla's mission will it serve, and, from a product
    perspective, how will it do so? Why has Mozilla undertaken this
    project? These goals should be based upon a shared understanding of
    the market ecosystem.

2.  Review the array of potential benefits that being open source can
    bring, as described in . Which ones, if any, resonate with your
    project's needs and goals? Note that no project should seek (or be
    expected to obtain) all of these benefits. The point of the review
    is to stimulate thought about which benefits are most important for
    your particular project --- and for which you should therefore
    optimize.

3.  Based on an understanding of project goals and the particular open
    source benefits you want to generate, find the archetype that seems
    like the best fit (see ).

4.  Use your chosen archetype to help drive a discussion within the
    project team and, as merited, with key external stakeholders. Review
    the questions in , to help determine if the archetype seems
    accurate, and if not, why not. The answers generated through this
    discussion will help the team make informed decisions about the open
    source project's licensing, governance and co-development models,
    and general management.

The set of archetypes in section is deliberately coarse-grained and
simplified. It is not important that a given project exactly match every
aspect of a particular archetype, and some projects may even incorporate
elements from different archetypes[^1]. In general, we expect most
projects will fit best with one archetype. Once that archetype is
identified, governance, licensing, process, and infrastructure decisions
can be made in light of it, with some adjustments for the project's
specific circumstances.

Once you are familiar with the archetypes, the questions in may be
useful to consider, along with the analysis exercises in and .

[^1]: For example, Open Stack is listed as an example for both the "Wide
    Open" and "Multi-Vendor Infrastructure" archetypes because it
    exhibits characteristics of both: significant project-wide
    investment in welcoming individual contributors and giving them
    influence, but still with the majority of overall development
    activity funded by organizations that have a sustained business
    interest in the project's success.
