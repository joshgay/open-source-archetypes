Use this page to draw a map or directed graph of current and potential
actors in your ecosystem. List service providers and group them by the
type of service they offer. Identify potential collaborators, and mark
the ones with competitive service offerings. Identify competing open
source and proprietary substitutes for your open source project.

Place actors with large, current impact closer to the center of the map
and future recruits further away. The open source project belongs at the
center, and your company might be close in or further out, depending on
its current effective scale of investment.

When done, note interesting relationships between various nodes on the
map. Add customers in another color. This map is a picture of your world
as it currently exists and how it might change in the near-term future.
Be sure to save a snapshot of this map and see how it shifts over time.
