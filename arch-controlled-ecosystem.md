Controlled Ecosystem {#archetype:controlled-ecosystem}
--------------------

**Examples:** *WordPress, Drupal*

**Characteristics:** Real community involvement, and diversity of
community motivations, but with a shared understanding that the founder
(or some credible entity) will act as "benevolent dictator". Requires
experienced open source community management on part of project leaders
and occasional willingness to compromise. Works best when technical
architecture directly supports out-of-core innovation and customization,
such as via a plugin system.

Controlled Ecosystem efforts find much of their value in that ecosystem.
The core provides base value, but the varied contributions across a
healthy plugin ecosystem allow the project to address a much larger and
diverse set of needs than any one project could tackle alone. Over time,
these projects might see more and more of the core functionality
structured as plugins as the product becomes more customizable and
pluggable. This increasingly lets the plugins determine the end-user
experience, and the core project can eventually become infrastructure.

-   **Licensing**: Can be either copyleft or non-copyleft. When
    copyleft, decisions must be made about whether the core interfaces
    (and maintainer-promulgated legal interpretations) encourage or
    discourage proprietary plugins.

-   **Community standards**: Welcoming, often with structures designed
    to promote participation and introduce new contributors.

-   **Component coupling**: Loosely coupled modules, frequently in a
    formal plugin system.

-   **Main benefits**: Builds a sustainable ecosystem in which the
    founding organization retains strong influence.

-   **Typical governance**: Benevolent dictatorship, with significant
    willingness to compromise to avoid forks.
